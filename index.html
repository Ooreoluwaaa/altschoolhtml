        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Ooreoluwa, I'm a 500l student of the department of
          Agricultural Economics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-ife, Osun
          State, Nigeria. I'm a baker and a web3 enthusiast. I love watching
          movies, especially chinese dramas, food videos on tiktok or instagram,
          I'm a good cook but I hate cooking so I'd rather starve than cook.

      <article id="Why">
        <h2>Why I joined the Program</h2>
        <p>
          To my tech journey, I've had passion for web development since 2022
          but I've had to hold back cos of funds though I started some free
          courses along the line but I couldn't be dedicated like I wanted
          because I didn't have a laptop. I got a laptop sometime this year, got
          accepted to a bootcamp later in the year which lasted for about 3
          months, it was an insightful program and compared to taking free
          courses with already made videos, we had live classes, could ask
          questions and also practice along, being a bootcamp, though very
          meaningful, I still have a lot of things i don't fully understand.
          Then an opportunity presented itself through Kiki Mordi and I was
          lucky to get a 50% scholarship, as someone who has always wanted to be
          a student at Altschool for the longest of time but was restricted cos
          of funds, this is a dream come true for me, this is a chance for me to
          learn under well experienced instructors as I've always wanted so I'm
          here to learn more from well experienced and trained instructors.
          </p>
          <article id="Goals">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>
          I
          hope I get all the necessary knowledge I need and after I'm done here,
          my knowledge has been broadened and I get certified as a Front End
          Engineer.
          <br> 
          And I also hope:
          <ul>
            <li>To acquire in-demand tech skills</li>
            <li>Improve my tech skills and become very good</li>
            <li>Be able to solve programming related problems</li>
            <li>To enhance my creativity using CSS and JavaScript</li>
            <li>To network and build connections</li>
            <li>To master programming languages</li>
            <li>To develop teamwork and collaboration skills</li>
            <li>To cultivate a growth mindset and a spirit that never gives up no matter what challenges</li>
          </ul>
